This is a simple but flexible inline keyboard generator that works as an add-on to PyTelegramBotAPI package. With **keyboa** you can:
- quickly create buttons with complex callback, 
- create keyboards directly from lists,
- easily combine multiple keyboards into one,
- many other cool things...

> üìñ This guide applies to Keyboa version 3 and above.
> If you are using Keyboa version 2 and below, please use [The guide for version 2](README_for_v2.md).

> üìå **IMPORTANT NOTICE**: 
> 
> Version 3 isn't compatible with version 2.
> If decide to update from 2 to 3 version, be aware that you will need to adjust your code.

## Installation
Keyboa is compatible with Python 3.7 and higher. You can install this package with pip as usual:
```sh
$ pip install keyboa
```
After that, just import:
```python
from keyboa import Keyboa
```

## Quick Start
### A minimal keyboard
The simplest telegram keyboard can be created like this:
```python
menu = ["spam", "eggs", "ham"]
keyboard = Keyboa(items=menu)
bot.send_message(chat_id=chat_id, text=text, reply_markup=keyboard())
```
![keyboard from list of str](https://telegra.ph/file/d9280b11ed11ec13e6f56.png)

### A simple structured keyboard
If you need to create a keyboard with a predefined structure, do the following:
```python
menu = [["spam", "eggs"], ["ham", "bread"], "spam"]
keyboard = Keyboa(items=menu)
bot.send_message(chat_id=chat_id, text=text, reply_markup=keyboard())
```
![keyboard from list of str](https://telegra.ph/file/2eb6752324fa196cae4ac.png)

That's a good start, but let's take a closer look at how it works and what additional features we can use.

## How it works 

The ```Keyboa``` class provides two options for creating pyTelegramBotAPI compatible keyboards with ```InlineKeyboardMarkup``` type: method ```slice()``` and property ```keyboard```.
Use the [Keyboa class](#keyboa-class) description below as a reference to understand the nuances and limitations of the module or see the following examples.

## Create keyboards
The easiest way to create a keyboard is to init Keyboa object with a list of items and get ```keyboard``` property.
```python
menu = ["spam", "eggs", "ham"]
keyboard = Keyboa(items=menu)
bot.send_message(chat_id=chat_id, text=text, reply_markup=keyboard())
```
![keyboard from list of str](https://telegra.ph/file/d9280b11ed11ec13e6f56.png)

By default, each item in the list becomes a separate row, but it's easy to change by combining the items into groups.
```python
menu = [["spam", "eggs"], ["ham", "bread"], "spam"]
keyboard = Keyboa(items=menu)
bot.send_message(chat_id=chat_id, text=text, reply_markup=keyboard())
```
![keyboard from list of str](https://telegra.ph/file/2eb6752324fa196cae4ac.png)

Now you see that the keyboard buttons are arranged according to how we grouped them in the list. 

Note that the last "spam" has become a separate row, although we have not put it on a separate list.

And of course you can create more complex structures, for example:
```python
menu = [["spam", "eggs", "ham"], ["ham", "eggs"], ["spam", ] ["sausages", "spam"], ["eggs", "spam", "spam"]]
keyboard = Keyboa(items=menu)
bot.send_message(chat_id=chat_id, text=text, reply_markup=keyboard())
```
![keyboard from list of str](https://telegra.ph/file/faff37512c626845c5524.png)

>Due to Telegram API limitation you can add **up to 8 buttons per row** and **up to 100 for the entire keyboard**.

Let's go deeper. Suppose you have a list of 24 items, and you would like to divide it into rows of 6 buttons each. Here is what you need to do:
```python
numbers = list(range(1, 25))
keyboard = Keyboa(items=numbers, items_in_row=6)
bot.send_message(chat_id=chat_id, text=text, reply_markup=keyboard())
```
![keyboard with 6 items_in_row](https://telegra.ph/file/2122cb9f50938b39b4439.png)

üí° You can easily make 3, 4 or even 8 buttons in a row, changing the ```items_in_row``` parameter only.

Now we will try to use more attributes to see how they will affect the result:
```python
keyboa = Keyboa(items=list(range(0, 48)), alignment=True)
keyboard = keyboa(slice(5, 37))
bot.send_message(chat_id=chat_id, text=text, reply_markup=keyboard)
```
![keyboard slice with alignment](https://telegra.ph/file/cc41513058a2b3d9f83ba.png)

As you can see, this keyboard consists of a ```[5:37]``` slice. In addition, although we did not specify the ```items_in_row``` attribute, the function divided list into equal rows, because of enabled ```alignment``` attribute.

## Create Buttons
üí° There is usually no need to create separate buttons as they will be created automatically from their source data when the keyboard is created.
But if there is such a need, it can be done as follows.
Import ```Button``` class ([detailed description](#button-class)), create button object from various data types, such as ```str```, ```int```, ```tuple```, ```dict``` and call ```button``` property to get ```InlineKeyboardButton```:
```python
from keyboa import Button
spam = Button(button_data="spam").button
```

#### button from ```str``` or ```int```
```python
spam = Button(button_data="spam").button
```
```sh
{'text': 'spam', 'callback_data': 'spam'}
```

#### button from ```tuple```
```python
spam = Button(button_data=("spam", "eggs"), front_marker="ham_", back_marker="_spam").button
```
```sh
{'text': 'spam', 'callback_data': 'ham_eggs_spam'}
```
üí° Notice that in this example we also used ```front_marker``` and ```back_marker``` to add some data to button's callback_data.

#### button from ```dict``` without "text" key
```python
spam = Button(button_data={"spam": "ham_eggs_spam"}).button
```
```sh
{'text': 'spam', 'callback_data': 'ham_eggs_spam'}
```

#### button from ```dict``` with "text" key
```python
spam = Button(button_data={"text": "spam", "url": "https://ya.ru/", "callback_data": "eggs"}).button
```
```sh
{"text": "spam", "url": "https://ya.ru/", "callback_data": "eggs"}
```

## Combine Keyboards
Sometimes it is necessary to combine several keyboard blocks into the big one. The Keyboa class method ```combine()``` does just that!

This method has only one input parameter - ```keyboards```. It should be a sequence of ```InlineKeyboardMarkup``` objects. Also could be presented as a standalone ```InlineKeyboardMarkup```.

Here is how it works:
```python
controls = [["‚èπÔ∏è", "‚è™Ô∏è", "‚èèÔ∏è", "‚è©Ô∏è", "‚ñ∂Ô∏è"], ]
tracks = list(range(1, 13))

keyboard_controls = Keyboa(items=controls).keyboard
keyboard_tracks = Keyboa(items=tracks, items_in_row=4).keyboard

keyboard = Keyboa.combine(keyboards=(keyboard_tracks, keyboard_controls))
bot.send_message(chat_id=user_id, text=text_tracks, reply_markup=keyboard)
```
![keyboard combo](https://telegra.ph/file/342c06d783faeb786f242.png)

As you see, we merged two keyboards into one.

## Complex callbacks
A few words about how to create complex callbacks for buttons. 

Often it is necessary to read and pass through the callback options that the user has sequentially selected. For example, determining the address: city, street, house, apartment number.

Suppose we offer the user several cities to choose from. Create a simple keyboard:
```python
kb_cities = Keyboa(
    items=["Moscow", "London", "Tokyo", ],
    front_marker="&city=",
    back_marker="$"
)
bot.send_message(chat_id=user_id, text="Select your city:", reply_markup=kb_cities())
```
![keyboard cities](https://telegra.ph/file/dcd011c72e43aefd8d00d.png)

By doing so, we get the following inside the keyboard:
```sh
{'inline_keyboard': [
    [{'text': 'Moscow', 'callback_data': '&city=Moscow$'}],
    [{'text': 'London', 'callback_data': '&city=London$'}],
    [{'text': 'Tokyo', 'callback_data': '&city=Tokyo$'}]
]}
```
Suppose a user selects ```London```. We would like to remember this, and let him choose from several streets:
```python
received_callback = call.data  # "&city=London$"
streets = ["Baker Street", "Oxford Street", "Abbey Road", ]
kb_streets = Keyboa(
    items=streets, 
    front_marker="&street=",
    back_marker=received_callback  # we added existing data to the end
)
bot.send_message(chat_id=user_id, text="Select your street:", reply_markup=kb_streets())
```
![keyboard streets](https://telegra.ph/file/cf06e3bc0adece894535d.png)

```sh
{'inline_keyboard': [
    [{
        'text': 'Baker Street',
        'callback_data': '&street=Baker Street&city=London$'}],
    [{
        'text': 'Oxford Street',
        'callback_data': '&street=Oxford Street&city=London$'}],
    [{
        'text': 'Abbey Road',
        'callback_data': '&street=Abbey Road&city=London$'}]
]}
```
üí° Notice that we used a ```front_marker``` to specify the type of current items, and a ```back_marker``` to attach existing information.

As you can see, the variant selected by the user in the previous step was also saved.
If the user selects a street, for example, ```Baker Street```, we will receive the ```call.data``` as ```'&street=Baker Street&city=London$'```. Of course we are able to parse it easily.

Finally, let him to choose an apartment:
```python
received_callback = call.data  # '&street=Baker Street&city=London$'
apartments = ["221a", "221b", "221c", ]
kb_apartments = Keyboa(
    items=apartments, 
    front_marker="&apartments=", 
    back_marker=received_callback  # we added existing data to the end
)
bot.send_message(chat_id=user_id, text="Select your apartments:", reply_markup=kb_apartments())
```
![keyboard streets](https://telegra.ph/file/0eec50498f2a68955c81c.png)

```sh
{'inline_keyboard': [[
        {'text': '221a',
        'callback_data': '&apartments=221a&street=Baker Street&city=London$'}, 
        {'text': '221b', 
        'callback_data': '&apartments=221b&street=Baker Street&city=London$'},
        {'text': '221c', 
        'callback_data': '&apartments=221c&street=Baker Street&city=London$'}
    ]]
}
```
And if the user selects button ```221b```, we will assume that üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Mr. Sherlock Holmes uses our bot too!

## Details
### Keyboa class
Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
```items``` | BlockItems | _Mandatory_. List of items for the keyboard. The total number should not be more than 100 due to the Telegram Bot API limitation.
```items_in_row``` | Integer | _Optional_. The number of buttons in one keyboard row. Must be **from 1 to 8** due to the Telegram Bot API limitation.<br>The default value is ```None```, which means that by default the keyboard structure depends on the grouping of  ```items``` elements.
```copy_text_to_callback``` | Boolean | If ```True```, and ```button_data``` is a ```str``` or an ```int```, function will copy button text to callback data (and add other markers if they exist).<br>The default value is ```True```.
```front_marker``` | CallbackDataMarker | _Optional_. Front part of callback data, which is common for all buttons.
```back_marker``` | CallbackDataMarker | _Optional_. Back part of callback data, which is common for all buttons.
```alignment``` | Boolean or Iterable | If ```True```, will try to split all items into **equal rows in a range of 3 to 5**.<br>If ```Iterable``` (with any ```int``` in the range from 1 to 8), will try to find a suitable divisor among them.<br><br>Enabled attribute replaces the action of ```items_in_row``` attribute, but if a suitable divisor cannot be found, function will use the ```items_in_row``` value if provided.<br><br>The default value is ```None```.
```alignment_reverse``` | Boolean | If ```True```, will try to find the divisor starting from the end of the ```auto_alignment``` variable (if defined) or from the default range.<br><br>Enabled attribute works only if ```auto_alignment``` is enabled.<br><br>The default value is ```None```.

```python
# structureless sequence of InlineButtonData objects
FlatSequence = List[InlineButtonData]

# structured sequence of InlineButtonData objects
StructuredSequence = List[Union[FlatSequence, InlineButtonData]]

# unified type that allows you to use any available data types for the keyboard
BlockItems = Union[StructuredSequence, InlineButtonData]
```

### Button class
Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
```button_data``` | InlineButtonData | An object from which the button will be created.<br>_See detailed explanation below._
```front_marker``` | CallbackDataMarker | _Optional_. An object to be added to the **left** side of callback.
```back_marker``` | CallbackDataMarker | _Optional_. An object to be added to the **right** side of callback.
```copy_text_to_callback``` | Boolean | If ```True```, and ```button_data``` is a ```str``` or an ```int```, function will copy button text to callback data (and add other markers if they exist).<br>The default value is ```False```.

All acceptable types combined into ```InlineButtonData``` type:
```python
InlineButtonData = Union[str, int, tuple, dict, InlineKeyboardButton]
```
Also there is a ```CallbackDataMarker``` type for callback data:
```python
CallbackDataMarker = Optional[Union[str, int]]
```

For ```button_data``` object --
* If it is a ```str``` or an ```int```, it will be used for text (and callback, if ```copy_text_to_callback``` is not disabled).
* If it is a ```tuple```, the zero element [0] will be the text, and the first [1] will be the callback. 
* If it is a ```dict```, there are two options:
   * if there is **no "text" key** in dictionary and only one key exists, the key will be the text, and the value will be the callback.<br>In this case no verification of the dictionary's contents is performed!
  * if the **"text" key exists**, function passes the whole dictionary to ```InlineKeyboardButton```, where dictionary's keys represent object's parameters and dictionary's values represent parameters' values accordingly.
In all other cases the ```ValueError``` will be raised.
